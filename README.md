# Data-Forecasting-By-Using-Time-Series-Analysis

In my professional practice, predictive data analysis plays a significant role in research and analysis. When dealing with issues such as macro trend judgment, market capacity estimation, or technological development path prediction, I extract insights from data using various methods to assist in decision-making, write research reports, or design business strategies.
This project uses Python to implement time series forecasting based on the SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, ideal for datasets with pronounced seasonal trends.
